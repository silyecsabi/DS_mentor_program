# EPAM Data Science Mentor Program

I participated and successfully completed this program from 2022.11.16 - 2023.04.19.

The course covers the essential DS tasks such as data preparation, regression, classification, clustering, basic image and text processing and neural networks. Each module includes theory studying, practice and quiz.

In this repository, you can find all of my homeworks I did through the course.

I successfully passed the 1.5 hour technical interview.
